=This is not an official Plurk API made in C#.=

This api is based on [http://code.google.com/p/rlplurkapi/ first unofficial plurk api].

My code needs some improvements and tests.If you wanna join to the project send me a mail at luisbebop@gmail.com.You can follow my profile in Plurk [http://www.plurk.com/user/luisbebop].

This code was made in Visual Studio 2008. You will need the Microsoft dot.net framework installed in your machine.
