plurkapi
===

Probably I'll rewrite this code in ruby. I uploaded this project to github only for personal backup. This project was originally hosted on google code (http://code.google.com/p/plurkapi).

This is not an official Plurk API made in C#.

This api is based on first unofficial plurk api (http://code.google.com/p/rlplurkapi/).

My code needs a lot of improvements and tests. You can follow my profile in Plurk (http://www.plurk.com/user/luisbebop).

This code was made in Visual Studio 2008. You will need the Microsoft dot.net framework installed in your machine.

*Don't use this API to evil ! :)*
